Project Title: UPSC Essay Evaluation using LangGraph

Description:
This project implements a parallel LLM-based workflow using LangGraph to evaluate essays on multiple dimensions:

Language Quality – evaluates grammar, vocabulary, and coherence

Clarity of Thought – assesses logical flow and idea organization

Depth of Analysis – measures critical thinking and insight

Each evaluation is done in parallel, and the workflow aggregates the results to provide a summarized overall feedback along with an average score. The system uses typed structured data (TypedDict) to ensure clear inputs and outputs and demonstrates modular, scalable essay evaluation with LLMs.

Tech Stack: Python, LangGraph, LLM API, TypedDicts for structured data.
